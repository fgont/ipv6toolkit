.SH SYNOPSIS
.B addr6
.RB [\| \-a
.IR IPV6_ADDR\| \ \-i]
.RB [\| \-q \|]
.RB [\| \-d \|]
.RB [\| \-s \|]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B addr6
is an IPv6 address analysis tool tool. It can employed identify the address type/scope, and infer the type of Interface ID employed by an IPv6 address. Additionally, the tool can filter lists of IPv6 addresses to eliminate duplicates, and can also produce statistics about a set of IPv6 addresses.

.SH OPTIONS
.B addr6
takes its parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be specified with a short name (one character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. “\-i”) or with a long name (a string preceded with two hyphen characters, as e.g. “\-\-stdin”).


.TP
.BI -a\  IPV6_ADDRESS ,\ \-\-address\  IPV6_ADDRESS

This option ca be employed to specify a single IPv6 address that is meant to be processed by the tool. This option is typically employed in conjunction with the '-d' tool, to decode the IPv6 address in question.

.TP
.BR \-i ,\  \-\-stdin

This option request the tool to read IPv6 addresses from standard input (stdin), until an EOF (End-Of-File) condition is found.

.TP
.BR \-q ,\  \-\-print\-unique

This option causes the tool to eliminate duplicate addresses from the list of IPv6 addresses read from standard input (stdin). That is, when reading a list of addresses from stdin, only the first "copy" of each address will be processed by the tool (with later ones being simply ignored).

.TP
.BR \-d ,\  \-\-print\-decode

This option request the tool to decode the IPv6 address specfied with the '-a' option (or a list of addresses read froom stdin if the '-i' option was set). The current version of the tool supports only decode type, in which information is printed for each address with the following syntax:

        AddressType=AddressSubtype=Scope=IIDTYpe=IIDSUbtype

This simple syntax is meant to be easy for scripting purposes. Future versions of the tool will incorporate a human-friendly mode.

.TP
.BR \-s\|  ,\  \-\-print\-stats

This option requests the tool to produce address statistics from the list of IPv6 addresses read from standard input. This option should be used in conjuction with the '-i' option, such that multiple addresses can be given as input to addr6.

addr6 will always print the total number of IPv6 addresses that have been examined, and the percentage of unicast, multicast, and unspecified (::) addresses. If at least one unicast address is identified, unicast-specific statistics will be printed. In the same way, if at least one multicast address is identified, then multicast-specific statistics will be printed.

Unicast-specific statistics include:

  1) Number and percentage of each unicast address type (global
     unicast, link-local unicast, 6to4, Teredo, etc.).

  2) Number and percentage of each of the different Interface
     ID types (IEEE-based, low-byte, etc.).

Only those unicast address types for which there are multiple possible types of Interface-IDs will be considered for the Interface-ID assessment. Namely,

  * 6to4
  * Global Unicast
  * Link-local Unicast
  * Site-local unicast addresses (deprecated)
  * Unique local unicast addresses

Unicast address types such as 'Teredo' are not considered by this analysis, since they have a single type of Interface-ID, as specified by the corresponding specifications.

Multicast-specific statistics include:

  1) Number of addresses and percentage of each multicast
     address type (Permanent, Embedded-RP, etc).
  
  2) Number addresses and percentage of each of the multicast
     address scope different Interface ID types (Link, Interfa-
     ce, Global, etc.)

.TP
.BR \-v\| ,\  \-\-verbose 

This option selects the “verbosity” of the tool. If this option is left unspecified, only minimum information is printed. 

.TP
.BR \-h\| ,\  \-\-help

Print help information for the 
.B addr6
tool. 

.SH EXAMPLES

The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the
.B addr6
tool.

\fBExample #1\fR

$ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -q

addr6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), and will only print the first instance of each address ('-q' option), thus effectively removing any duplicates from the list.

    Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
    from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
    redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.


\fBExample #2\fR

$ addr6 -a fc00::1

Decode the IPv6 address spcified with the '-a' option. Note that while the '-d' option was not set, this is the default behavior of the tool (unless overriden y another option).


\fBExample #3\fR

$ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -q -s

addr6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will ignore duplicate addresses ('-q' option), and will print statistics about the processed IPv6 addresses.

    Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
    from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
    redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.


\fBExample #4\fR

$ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -q -d

addr6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will ignore duplicate addresses ('-q' option), and will decode each of the remaining addresses.

    Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
    from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
    redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.
